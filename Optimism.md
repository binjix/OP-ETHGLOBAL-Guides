## 1. Introduction
  
The [Optimism Collective](https://app.optimism.io/announcement) is a band of companies, communities, and citizens working together to reward public goods and build a sustainable future for Ethereum.

Together we will dispel the myth that public goods cannot be profitable. Public goods (such as Optimism and Ethereum) often go underfunded when incentives aren't properly aligned, forcing many to make trade-offs between earning a profit and building for the common good. We are bound by a mutually beneficial pact, [our vision](https://www.optimism.io/vision) can be summed up with the equation **Impact = Profit**.

[You can read more about who we are and what we are doing here](http://localhost:8080/docs/governance/#how-can-we-achieve-this).
